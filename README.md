ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @santy-gegenschatz

I'm a research scientist and software engineer from ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·.

I'm deeply interested in machine learning applications for biotech and AI.

I'm a decent coder, not spectacular yet, but getting consistently better through deliberate practice.

(went from 0 to deploying my own app and it being used used in 70+ countries and still striving forward for more growth and knowledge)
