ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @santy-gegenschatz

I'm a research scientist and software engineer from ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·.

I'm deeply interested in machine learning applications for biotech and AI.

I went from being a terrible coder to being a quite decent one, and am getting better thorugh deliberate practice.

(eg: deployed my own app and it has been used used in 70+ countries. Also, more complex and advanced apps are on the way.)

Check out some of my projects here.
