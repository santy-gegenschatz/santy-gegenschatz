ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @santy-gegenschatz

I'm a research scientist and software engineer from ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·.

I'm deeply interested in machine learning applications for biotech and AI.

I'm a decent coder, not spectacular yet, but getting consistently better through deliberate practice.
(went from 0 to deploying my own app, and still striving forward for more growth)
