ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @santy-gegenschatz

I'm a research scientist and software engineer from ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡·.

I'm deeply interested in machine learning applications for biotech and AI.

Unfortunately, I'm only a decent coder, but am trying to get better through deliberate practice.ğŸ™ˆ

Check out some of my projects here:

Feel free to connect, I'm here to learn from others because I'm typically quite incompetent.
